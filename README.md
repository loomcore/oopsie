# oopsie v0.0.1

A bit of nonsense code to help me wrap my head around OOP in
Moonscript.  I found super-basic MS examples hard to come by, so
here's hoping it helps someone else out.  It implements two simple
counters in TIC-80, initialising each to a different value and
allowing each to be incremented by pressing the A and B buttons (Z and
X on the keyboard) respectively.
